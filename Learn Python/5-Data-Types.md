## DataTypes:
In programming, a data type is a classification of data that defines the characteristics of the data and the operations that can be performed on it. In Python, data types are used to define the type of a variable or a value.
Each data type has specific characteristics and behavior, and the data type of a variable determines how that variable can be used and what operations can be performed on it. For example, an integer data type can be used for mathematical operations, while a string data type can be used for text manipulation. <br/>
 1. **Numbers**: used to store numeric values. Examples include integers (e.g. 1, 2, 3) and floating-point numbers (e.g. 3.14, 1.23).
```python
x = 5
y = 3.14
```
2. **Strings**: used to store text data. Strings can be defined using single or double quotes.
```python
name = "Alice"
address = 'New York'
```
3. Lists: used to store a collection of items. Lists are enclosed in square brackets and items are separated by commas.
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
```
4. **Tuples**: similar to lists, but are immutable (i.e. the items cannot be modified once created). Tuples are also enclosed in parentheses and items are separated by commas.
```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3)
```
5. **Dictionaries**: used to store key-value pairs. Dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces and items are separated by commas.
 ```python
 person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}
```
6. **Boolean**: used to store true or false values.
```python
is_student = True
is_employee = False
```
7. **Sets** : unordered collection of unique elements.
```python
fruits = {'apple', 'banana', 'orange'}
```
8. **None**: used to represent the absence of a value or a null value.
```python
x = None
```
*These are the basic data types in python and you can use them to store different types of data in your program.*
