## Variables:
 A variable is a name that refers to a value. Variables are used to store data values, and they can be used in various ways to manipulate and operate on that data.
 
To create a variable in Python, you simply assign a value to a name using the assignment operator `(=)`. For example:
```python
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"
```
Here, `x` is a variable with the value `5`, and `y` is a variable with the value `"Hello, World!"`. You can also use `x = 5` and `y = "Hello, World!"` as a shortcut to creating variables.
You can also use the variables in operations and assign the result to a new variable.
```python
x = 5
y = 3
z = x + y
```
Here, `z` is a new variable with the value of `x + y`, which is `8`.

You can also reassign new values to variables that have been already defined.
```python
x = 5
x = x + 1
```
Here, `x` is reassigned with the new value 5 + 1 which is 6.

In python, it is also possible to assign multiple variables in a single statement
```python
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
```
Here `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `z` is 3.

Python is a **dynamically** typed language, which means that you don't need to specify the **type** of a variable when you create it. Python will automatically determine the type of a variable based on the value that is assigned to it.
