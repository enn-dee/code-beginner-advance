## Simple "Hello, World!" program in Python:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
**Explanation:**

The first line `print("Hello, World!")` is a function call to the `print()` function. This function is used to output text to the screen. The text to be printed is passed to the function as an argument, which in this case is the string `"Hello, World!"`. <br/>
That's it! This one line program takes the string `"Hello, World!"` and prints it to the console. With this simple program you have written your first Python code.

### Run:
To run the program, you'll need to have a Python interpreter installed on your computer. You can then execute the program by running the command `python` followed by the name of the python file. <br/>
```python
python main.py
```
This will execute the code and you should see the output "Hello, World!" printed to the console.

You also can run it on an *ide*, an integrated development environment that provides debugging and editing functionality. This way you can see the output, fix errors and work more efficiently on your Python projects.
